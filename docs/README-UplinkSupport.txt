UplinkSupport.exe sends crash reports to Introversion if Uplink crashes.

It is modified from XCrashReport, as presented in "XCrashReport : Exception
Handling and Crash Reporting" by Hans Dietrich, and all credit for the techniques
used goes to Hans.

See http://www.codeproject.com/debug/XCrashReportPt1.asp for the original.
